# Ideas - future expansion

## Three puzzle variants
1. Convert to single line of characters.
Highlight X characters (instead of one character in four different "panes")

2. PIN lock
Keypad logs are unobiquitous in thrillers; a quintessential puzzle - and woute simple to do

3. Drag and drop
There are X slots, where items carrying a symbol can be slotted in by dragging and dropping.
The draggable items can have symbols or images on them.

## Dashboard
Users can create a puzzle in the dashboard, with settings for all sort of things.  
- Puzzle config is saved to a CMS (Sanity?).  
- Link is shareable
- Puzzles can be linked (?)
- Choose a symbol set (different fonts)
- Choose passcode (correct answer)
- Choose number of symbols (total)
- Number of alternatives (spare) symbols
- Color scheme
- Background graphic (choose among templates)

## Monetization
Ads?
Buy temporary or permanent "ad free".
Only permanent is probably best - 0.5 euro or so per week, or month maybe?
